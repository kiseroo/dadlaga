# KML Directory Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This project has been refactored to use only the `public/khoroo2021` directory for storing and serving KML files, removing all references to the root `khoroo2021` directory.

## Changes Made
1. Updated all API endpoints to reference only the `public/khoroo2021` directory:
   - `pages/api/serve-kml.js`
   - `pages/api/list-khoroos.js`
   - `pages/api/compare-kml.js`
   - `pages/api/kml-files.js`

2. Created verification script `verify-refactoring.ps1` to check for any remaining references to the root directory.

3. Updated `cleanup.ps1` to include an option for removing the root `khoroo2021` directory.

## Remaining Tasks
1. **Remove Root KML Directory**: The root `khoroo2021` directory is now redundant and can be removed.
   - Uncomment the appropriate line in `cleanup.ps1` or run:
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item -Path '.\khoroo2021' -Force -Recurse
   ```

2. **Remove KML Archive**: If you no longer need the backup, you can remove `khoroo2021.rar`.
   - Uncomment the appropriate line in `cleanup.ps1` or run:
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item -Path '.\khoroo2021.rar' -Force
   ```

3. **Test the Application**: Make sure all KML loading functionality works correctly using only the `public/khoroo2021` directory.

## Directory Structure
- `public/khoroo2021/`: Contains all KML files needed by the application
- `pages/api/`: Contains the API endpoints for serving and managing KML files
- `components/Map.js`: Main map component that displays KML data

## Verification
A verification script has been created to ensure no references to the root `khoroo2021` directory remain:
```powershell
.\verify-refactoring.ps1
```

If the script execution is blocked by PowerShell security policies, you can manually check for references with:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path . -Filter "*.js" -Recurse | Select-String -Pattern "khoroo2021(?!/)" | Where-Object { $_ -notmatch "public/khoroo2021" -and $_ -notmatch "public[\\\/]khoroo2021" }
```
